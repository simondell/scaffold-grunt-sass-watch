# Grunt/Sass/Livereload

A bare-bones HTML & sass scaffold with a dev server & live-reload.

This little project would be more useful as a [Yeoman][] generator, and there is probably usch a thing already in npm. If you can find one, or you made one, let me know! The generators I've found so far all installed more tools than I wanted.
